<b>Reflective analysis</b>

Who did you design your map for? 

What questions or needs does the map attempt to raise or address? In what respects is your map successful and unsuccessful in this?

What process did you follow in the design/iteration of the map? 

How does your map incorporate interactivity in a way that adds understanding? 

What are the intellectual justifications for your choices of data and cartographic stylings?

In what ways could your map be improved? 

Making reference to relevant cartographic/interaction principles you've learned in readings will improve your work.
